## Adjusting Camera Settings
1. Press the 'Camera' button in the top left to access various camera settings.

## Adding Color Palettes
1. Visit https://lospec.com/palette-list to browse and download palettes. Download them in .HEX file format.
2. Connect the camera to your computer via USB.
3. Press the 'USB' button on the top of the display. This will mount the onboard storage as a removable drive. NOTE: The USB interface is quite slow and it may take up to a minute for the removable drive to be fully detected and readable.
4. Transfer the downloaded .HEX palettes into the folder "palette".
5. Disconnect the camera and turn it on. The palettes should now be selectable in the color palettes page.

## Transferring Photos
1. Connect the camera to your computer via USB.
2. Press the 'USB' button on the top of the display. This will mount the onboard storage as a removable drive. NOTE: The USB interface is quite slow and it may take up to a minute for the removable drive to be fully detected and readable.
3. All photos taken will be in the root director, in JPG format.
4. If there are compatibility issues with your computer, you can also physically remove the onboard microSD card and insert it into a memory card reader. You can do so by slowly pulling the display and the attached circuit board off of the enclosure. BE CAREFUL! If you exert too much force you might detach the display from the circuit board and possibly break it. You should only use this method as a last resort. Try using a different computer first before doing this.

## Charging The Battery
1. Connect the camera to a USB charger or to a computer via USB.
2. IMPORTANT: Ensure the power switch is turned on. The battery is now charging.
3. NOTE: The battery % indicator is VERY INACCURATE and should only be used as an estimate.
